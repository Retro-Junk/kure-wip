Zone format

A "Zone" represents an unique room in the game. All zones are bundled in ZONES.BIN.

NB! All "word" entries are stored in big-endian format!

Zone entry format:
  byte  Area               // Zone's Area index
  byte  Room               // Room index
  byte  Name               // Zone name
  byte  Palette            // Zone palette
  byte  NumSpots           // Number of Spots
  // followed by NumSpots spot reactions entries:
  struc Reactions[NumSpots] {
    word Mask              // each non-zero bit from 4 to 0 signifies that corresponding reaction command is present
    word Command[]         // up to 5 reaction commands for Psi powers: Sticky Fingers, Brainwarp, Know Mind, Psi Shift, Extreme Violence
  }
  // followed by NumSpots room spots records
  struc Spots[NumSpots] {
    prect Rect             // spot rect (packed screen-absolute coordinates)
    byte  Flags            //
    byte  Name             // spot name/hint
    word  Command          // interaction command
  }

Area index specifies common index for different parts of the same (logical) zone.
This is useful for zones that have multiple view angles and hence different Zone indexes.

Room index specifies index in ARPLA.BIN , which is used to actually draw room's background/static objects.
